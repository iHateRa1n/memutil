# memutil
memutil is a simple scripting utility to script memory edits.
# How to use
First, create a file. Call it whatever you want. This will hold our instructions.
If you want to read a memory address, put 'read' and then the memory address.
If you want to write to a memory address, put 'write', then the address, and then the data. (Integers only)
Now, save the file.
Then, run in the folder './memutil' followed by the filename.
Tinker, and enjoy!
